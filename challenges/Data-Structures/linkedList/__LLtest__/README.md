# Challenge Summary
Linked list insertions.6

## Challenge Description
* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node


## Approach & Efficiency
for **`InserAfter()`**: 
1. I used while loop to loop over the linked list and when finding the new value adding the node after it
2. complexity: 
  - space:
