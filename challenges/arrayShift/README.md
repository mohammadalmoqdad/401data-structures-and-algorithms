# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
i have no background about inserting an element intead of another element because i used to use the splice() method

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
today's code challenge is writting the method splice somehow becasue it looks exactly do the same job except the deleting stuff. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used copying array approach to make a copy of the array and avoid being changed when entering a value to it.
Space: big O(m*n+1)
m: the length of the array
speed: big O(2)
